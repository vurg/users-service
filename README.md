# Users Service

This service handles all user related functions, CRUD operations, and authentication.

# Setup

## Local install
Clone the latest code
```
git clone git@git.chalmers.se:courses/dit355/2023/student-teams/dit356-2023-04/users-service.git
```
If you do not have pipenv:
``` pip install pipenv ```<br/>

Otherwise start the virtualenv:
```
pipenv shell
```
Now install required dependencies from requirements.txt:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Check that all depencies have been correctly installed by running ```pip freeze```

### Setup database
Install postgreSQL if you have not, then create an empty database.

In the repository, create a ```.env``` file in the root directory, same directory as ```.env.dist```, and follow the instructions inside ```.env.dist```.

Now you have to apply django database migrations, first run:
```
python manage.py makemigrations
```
Then:
```
python manage.py migrate
```
Whenever you modify the database model, please redo this step or the changes will not be applied.

### Running the server
To start the service, be in the root directory, you can also specify the port (Optional):
```
python manage.py runserver

python manage.py runserver 127.0.0.1:8001
```

## Docker

Must have docker installed on your computer.

Run docker-compose.yml
```
docker-compose up -d
```
Now apply the same database migration process:
```
docker-compose run web python manage.py migrate
```
where ```web``` is the service name specified in docker-compose.yml.
If connection errors occur in the web container, restarting it should fix the problem.

Note that the data in this container is persistent storage, and will only be lost if you delete the container.

</br>
If you just want to run it as a docker container while still using your local database, it is a lot simpler.

In root directory, run:

```
docker build -t name .

docker run -p computer_port:container_port your_image_name
```

When you do this, you must also set the database host to ```host.internal.docker``` in ```settings.py``` in order for the container to access the postgres database running on your machine, as the container's localhost is different from your localhost.
